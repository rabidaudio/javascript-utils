Overlay/popup library for jQuery
--------------------------------

Use $.overlay.create(content) and pass it a string, DOMObject, or jQueryObject as the content of the popup.
The popup will keep itself in the middle of the page, through scrolls and window resizes.
When done, kill it with $.overlay.destroy()
To check if a popup is displayed, use $.overlay.on

Eventually, I will remove the jQuery dependancy, as this is more CSS dependant than JS.
